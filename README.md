# C-string Wrapper Exercise

An Exercism.io-like exercise to create a C library that provides a wrapper type for strings

# The task

To build a simple wrapper around native C strings.

The header in `include/str_t.h` declares signatures for the functions you need to implement.

The tests in `tests/test_str_t.c` specify how the functions should behave.

# Usage

Build and run the tests:

```
$ make test
```

Clean build outputs:

```
$ make clean
```

Clean build outputs and remove downloaded dependencies:

```
$ make clobber
```
